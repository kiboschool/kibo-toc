            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>One of the things we are most proud of is creating a high-quality online learning experience. Too often, learning online is perceived as (and really often is) inferior to in-person experiences. We proved that online learning online could be as good – and often better – than in-person learning. With a diligent and thoughtful focus on learning design, we built and delivered thousands of hours of engaging asynchronous lessons and active live classes.</p>
            <p>We’re making these materials available here with a CCO license, so that other educators can use and improve on them. </p>

            <h2>BS in Computer Science</h2>
            <p>The degree combines a foundation in computer science theory with practical skills in software development, communication and collaboration. Curriculum materials for first two years of the degree program are listed below.</p>

The focus of this course is to provide students with the tools and skills to create meaningful technology solutions (e.g. services, products) to a sustainable development problem. The course will utilize virtual studio time, where groups work together on the key incremental tasks that are required to allow them to create their final project output successfully. Studio time will be supported by lectures, seminars, and learning resources on useful skills such as human-centered design, end-user identification, requirements gathering, value creation, impact measurement, and creative thinking and innovation. </p>

                <p>This course builds on Data Structures & Algorithms 1. Students will explore non-linear data structures, and implement and analyze advanced algorithms.</p>
                <p>The course begins with a brief review of basic data structures and algorithms. Students deepen their understanding of searching and sorting, with a focus on describing performance. They learn about advanced data structures including priority queues, hash tables and binary search trees. Students build on their knowledge of graph theory to implement graph algorithms, and explore topics like finding the shortest paths in graphs, and applications of algorithms in maps, social networks, and a host of real-life applications. Other key topics include: divide and conquer, recursion, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, computability theory, and case studies in algorithm design.</p>
                <p>The course emphasizes big-picture understanding and practical problem-solving in preparation for technical interviews and professional practice. Students will solve common algorithmic problems, and participate in mock interview sessions. Students will write technical blog posts to deepen their understanding of these topics and to practice technical communication.</p>
