# Course Tools
<!-- UPDATE EACH TERM -->

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **GitHub** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our
  project and assignment code.
- **GitHub Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on
  Github.
- **Visual Studio Code** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has
  many plugins which can extend the features and capabilities of the
  application.  Take time to learn how ot use VS Code (and other key tools)
  because you will ultimately save enormous amounts of time.  
- **Anchor** is Kibo's Learning Management System (LMS). You will access your
  course content through this website, track your progress, and see your grades
  through this site.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
  submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
  you get credit towards your degree.
