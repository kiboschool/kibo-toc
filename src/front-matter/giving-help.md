# Giving Help

Providing help to peers in a way that fosters learning and collaboration while
maintaining academic integrity is crucial. Here are some guidelines that a
computer science university student can follow:

1. **Understand University Policies:**
   - Familiarize yourself with [Kibo's Academic Honesty and Integrity
     Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hk90x4UxSVna-1WCIBwa9ELPSGIh9Lp43pEu9-LBluI/preview#heading=h.ji8lxk5bitwu).
     This policy is designed to protect the value of your degree, which is
     ultimately determined by the ability of our graduates to apply their
     knowledge and skills to develop high quality solutions to challenging
     problems--not their grades!

2. **Encourage Independent Learning:**
   - Rather than giving direct answers, guide your peers to resources,
     references, or methodologies that can help them solve the problem on their
     own. Encourage them to understand the concepts rather than just finding the
     correct solution.  Work through examples that are different from the
     assignments or practice problems provide in the course to demonstrate the
     concepts.

3. **Collaborate, Don't Complete:**
   - Collaborate on ideas and concepts, but avoid completing assignments or
     projects for others. Provide suggestions, share insights, and discuss
     approaches without doing the work for them or showing your work to them.

4. **Set Boundaries:**
   - Make it clear that you're willing to help with understanding concepts and
     problem-solving, but you won't assist in any activity that violates
     academic integrity policies.

5. **Use Group Study Sessions:**
   - Participate in group study sessions where everyone can contribute and learn
     together. This way, ideas are shared, but each individual is responsible
     for their own understanding and work.

6. **Be Mindful of Collaboration Tools:**
   - If using collaboration tools like version control systems or shared
     documents, make sure that contributions are clear and well-documented.
     Clearly delineate individual contributions to avoid confusion.

7. **Refer to Resources:**
   - Direct your peers to relevant textbooks, online resources, or
     documentation. Learning to find and use resources is an essential skill,
     and guiding them toward these materials can be immensely helpful both in
     the moment and your career.

8. **Ask Probing Questions:**
   - Instead of providing direct answers, ask questions that guide your peers to
     think critically about the problem. This helps them develop problem-solving
     skills.

9. **Be Transparent:**
   - If you're unsure about the appropriateness of your assistance, it's better
     to seek guidance from professors or teaching assistants. Be transparent
     about the level of help you're providing.

10. **Promote Honesty:**
    - Encourage your peers to take pride in their work and to be honest about
      the level of help they received. Acknowledging assistance is a key aspect
      of academic integrity.

Remember, the goal is to create an environment where students can learn from
each other (after all, we are better together) while we develop our individual
skills and understanding of the subject matter.
