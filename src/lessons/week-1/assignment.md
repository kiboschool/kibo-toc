# Assignment 1: Title

Link to start the assignment (often a GitHub Classroom Link).

## Overview

Overview of the assignment including any starter elements that are provided.  

## Steps

Steps that students must follow in order to complete the assignments.


## Grading

Grading criteria so that students know what is expected of them.  A rubric
is ideal and will make grading the assignment go more quickly. 

This is an example rubric for a into programming course.

| Criteria                            | Proficient                                        | Competent                                          | Developing                                       |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Coding Style (20%)**              |                                                   |                                                    |                                                  |
| 1. Indentation and Formatting       | Code is consistently well-indented and follows PEP 8 formatting guidelines. | Code is mostly well-indented and follows PEP 8 guidelines with minor deviations. | Code lacks consistent indentation and does not follow PEP 8 guidelines. |
| 2. Naming Conventions               | Meaningful and consistent variable/function/class names following PEP 8 conventions. | Mostly meaningful names, with occasional inconsistencies. | Variable/function/class names are unclear or inconsistent. |
| 3. Comments and Documentation       | Comprehensive comments and clear documentation for major functions and complex logic. | Adequate comments explaining major sections of code. | Lack of comments or insufficient documentation. |
| 4. Appropriate Use of Language Constructs | Demonstrates advanced understanding and appropriate use of Python language constructs (e.g., list comprehensions, generators). | Generally applies language constructs correctly, with occasional lapses. | Misuses or misunderstands key language constructs. |
| **Persistence (50%)**               |                                                   |                                                    |                                                  |
| 5. Completeness                     | Evidence that all components of the assignment were attempted.  All functionality present. | Evidence that most elements of the assignment were attempted. Most functionality present. | Little evidence of completion of work.  Incomplete or major functionality missing.        |
| 6. Timeliness                       | Assignment started early (based on GitHub data).  GitHub commits show steady progress. Submitted on time. | Assignment is submitted late but GitHub data demonstrates an early or reasonable start date, with significant iteration on arrival to solution (i.e., multiple commits showing progress) | Submitted late. GitHub repository data shows late start and minimal iteration. |
| 7. Use of Resources                 | Assignment is fully complete and provides all functionality. If assignment is not fully complete, student attended office hours (or additional help sessions) and/or asked high quality and timely questions on Discord. | Assignment is not fully complete and there is minor evidence of effort to get assistance on assignment (e.g., office hours attendance or Discord discussions). | Assignment is incomplete and no evidence of seeking assistance. |
| **Correctness (30%)**               |                                                   |                                                    |                                                  |
| 8. Test Cases                       | Percentage of automated test cases that pass. |||

> **Evidence of Persistence:**
>
> In the event that you are unable to get your program fully functional, you
> will receive partial credit based on your evidence showing the amount of
> effort that went into learning the underlying concepts to complete the
> assignment or that you persistently sought appropriate assistance. Examples of
> persistence may include, but is not limited to, the following: Git commit
> history showing evolution of your program, attendance to office hours
> (Instructor or TA), asking thoughtful questions in the appropriate Discord
> forums, formation of study groups, completion of additional practice
> exercises, reading of third-party resources, etc.  
>
> To receive partial credit, you **must** create a file called `PERSISTENCE.md`
> in your GitHub repo alongside the `README.md` file, and include your evidence
> of persistence, for example, links to your Discord questions, narrative
> explaining dates and times of office hour sessions that you attended and what
> you learned, links to resources that you referenced, links to ChatGPT
> conversations that you initiated (focusing on concepts not just getting
> answers), etc. The better you can demonstrate your work on learning, the
> easier it will be to provide partial credit, so be thorough. Make sure that
> file is properly committed to your repo, and included in your Gradescope
> submission.

## Submitting Your Work

Your work must be submitted Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for
grading.

**For coding tasks involving Github Classroom:**

1. Ensure that you `commit` and `push` your local code changes to your remote
   repository.  (Note: In general, you should commit and push frequently, so
   that you have a backup of your work, so that there is evidence that you did
   your own work, and so that you can return to a previous state easily.)
2. Upload your submission to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the
   appropriate submission link by selecting the correct GitHub repository from
   the drop-down list.
3. Export a zip archive of your GitHub repository by visiting your repo on
   [GitHub](https://www.github.com), clicking on the green `Code` button, and
   selecting "Download Zip".
4. Upload the zip file of your repository to Anchor using the form below.

**For cases where you answer questions on Gradescope:**

1. Complete the work in [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) by navigating
   tot he appropriate link.
2. Export it as a pdf using th Google Chrome plugin:
   [https://gofullpage.com/](https://gofullpage.com/).  This plugin will do
   multiple screen captures while scrolling through your document, and then
   stitch them into a pdf that you can download.
3. Upload the generated pdf to Anchor using the form below.

**For any work completed outside of GitHub or Gradescope:**

1. Take either screen captures of your work or export a pdf showing your
   complete work.
2. Submit the materials to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the
   appropriate submission link for the course.
3. Upload the screen captures or pdf files to Anchor using the form below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is
> **critical** that you upload all of your work to Anchor before the last day of
> the term.  Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or
> the late deadline, if applicable).
